# StatStrat

StatStrat is an iOS app that lets you track players statistics on Hypixel. Using the Hypixel API along with many others it will display any statistics for a player of your choice(as long as they are a valid player) and display their statistics in a nice and easy to understand manner. This app will also track your daily statistics using Firebase Cloud Functions which ensures your daily statistics are reset every 5 minutes.

## How I built it
StatStrat was built using Swift and SwiftUI and most user data is recieved from the [Hypixel API](https://api.hypixel.net/). Firebase was used to store all player data and keep track of daily statistics for all players using cloud functions.
